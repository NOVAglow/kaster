# This is a sample .kasterrc file (default values set).
# .kasterrc file is a file that stores your configuration for Kaster.
# Configurations in .kasterrc include:
#     1. Path to Kaster's home directory (where Kaster's source files are kept)
#     2. Path to user's home directory (where user's files are kept e.g. those
#        that store the logins' credentials)
#     3. Date format
#     4. Time format
#
# You may use this as your actual .kasterrc file, providing that:
#     - You don't change any variable's name
#       (those that stand on the left side of the equal sign)
#     - You don't remove any hash symbol ("#")
#     - The values for the variables are valid (a value of a variable stands
#       on the right side of the equal sign)


# Kaster's home directory: Where Kaster stores its source code files
# Default value: /usr/lib/kaster {string}
program_file_dir = "/usr/lib/kaster"

# User's home directory: Where user's files are kept
