Password Standard
  Description:

    A password standard defines rules that passwords must follow
    in order for them to be considered "strong" - That is, a strong password.

    In Kaster, password standards define 6 things, they are:
      - Range for password's length
      - Range for number of uppercase characters
      - Range for number of lowercase characters
      - Range for number of numerical characters
      - Range for number of special characters
      - How much something can be off a range (the author calls that "EP")

    By default, password standards are stored in .std files
    in /usr/share/kaster/std/.
    They have the following structure:

    [Name of Standard]
    [EP]
    [Minimum length]:[Maximum length]
    [Minimum number of uppercase chars]:[Maximum number of uppercase chars]
    [Minimum number of lowercase chars]:[Maximum number of lowercase chars]
    [Minimum number of numerical chars]:[Maximum number of numerical chars]
    [Minimum number of special chars]:[Maximum number of special chars]

    You can view the Kaster Password Standard (kaster.std)
    for an example. Kaster Password Standard is a standard used to check
    if the master password is strong enough, and it is created
    if you call the vault and throw the option '--account' in.
    You can create your own or add your own standards, too.

  Options

    --std=std : Check if std's a valid file containing password standard.
                If yes, read out the content of the standard.
                Note: std is the file's name, not the full path.
