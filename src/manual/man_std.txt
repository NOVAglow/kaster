Password Standard
  Description:

    A password standard defines rules that passwords must follow
    in order for them to be considered "strong" - That is, a strong password.

    In Kaster, password standards define 6 things, they are:
      - Range for password's length
      - Range for number of uppercase characters
      - Range for number of lowercase characters
      - Range for number of numerical characters
      - Range for number of special characters
      - How much something can be off a range (the author calls that "EP")

    Password standards are stored in .std files in /usr/share/kaster/std/.
    They have the following structure:

    [Name of Standard]
    [EP]
    [Minimum length]:[Maximum length]
    [Minimum number of uppercase characters]:[Maximum number of uppercase characters]
    [Minimum number of lowercase characters]:[Maximum number of lowercase characters]
    [Minimum number of numerical characters]:[Maximum number of numerical characters]
    [Minimum number of special characters]:[Maximum number of special characters]

    You can view the Kaster Password Standard (/usr/share/kaster/std/kaster.std)
    for an example. Kaster Password Standard is a standard used to check if the master
    password is strong enough, and it is created if you call the vault and throw the
    option '--account' in. You can create your own or add your own standards, too.

  Options

    --std=std : Check if std is a valid file containing password standard. If yes,
                read out the content of the standard.
